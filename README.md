Intelligent Customer Help Desk with Smart Document Understanding
.PROJECT SUMMARY : 
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of a computer program or a machine to think and learn.It is also a field of study which 
tries to make computers "smart". They work on their own without being encoded with commands.The typical customer care chatbot can answer
simple questions, such as store locations and hours, directions. When a question falls outside of the scope of the pre-determined question
set, the option is typically to tell the customer the question isn’t valid or offer to speak to a real person.
But in this project we build a chatbot in such a way that it answers all the queries related to the functioning of the system. 
It does that by using the Watson Discovery Service,which has been pre-loaded with the device’s owners manual.
